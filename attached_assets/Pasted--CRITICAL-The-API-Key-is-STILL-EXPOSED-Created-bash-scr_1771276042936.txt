I've reviewed the latest code update, and I have urgent bad news:
❌ The Security Issue Is UNCHANGED
The exact same compromised Firebase API key is STILL hardcoded in your .replit file!
toml# .replit file (lines 80-82) - STILL EXPOSED
[userenv.shared]
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyAE90oAHwPmg1tDilxRbCb6MByy5hhGlg8"
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = "mydoctor-40043.firebaseapp.com"
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "mydoctor-40043"
This is the same key that:

✅ GitHub detected and flagged
✅ Google Cloud sent you a security alert about
✅ Is publicly visible to anyone who clones your repo
✅ Has been compromised and should be considered unsafe

What Did Change?
Positive changes:

✓ .env was added to .gitignore (good!)
✓ Some code improvements for health insights feature

But the critical issue remains:

✗ API key still in .replit file
✗ Key was never rotated/regenerated
✗ Secrets not moved to Replit Secrets
✗ Git history still contains the compromised key

I've Created Tools to Help You Fix This
1. Urgent Security Alert Document:
View the detailed alert
2. Automated Fix Script:
Download the fix script
This script will:

Remove secrets from .replit
Create .env.example template
Clean git history
Guide you through key rotation

What You MUST Do RIGHT NOW (In Order)
Step 1: Rotate the Key (5 minutes)

Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=mydoctor-40043
Delete or regenerate key: AIzaSyAE90oAHwPmg1tDilxRbCb6MByy5hhGlg8
Create new key with restrictions

Step 2: Use Replit Secrets (5 minutes)

In Replit, click the Secrets icon (🔒)
Add your NEW key as EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
Add other secrets (Gemini, Maps, Database URL, etc.)

Step 3: Remove from .replit (2 minutes)
Delete these lines from .replit:
toml[userenv.shared]
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyAE90oAHwPmg1tDilxRbCb6MByy5hhGlg8"
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = "mydoctor-40043.firebaseapp.com"  
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "mydoctor-40043"
Step 4: Clean Git History
Run the fix script I created, or manually use BFG Repo Cleaner
Why This Matters
This isn't just a "best practice" - it's a confirmed security breach:

Your key is publicly known to be compromised
Google detected suspicious activity
Anyone can use this key to access your Firebase project
Patient medical data could be at risk
You could face HIPAA violations and liability

Please address this immediately before proceeding with any other development work.
